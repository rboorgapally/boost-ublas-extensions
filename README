This extension of Boost uBLAS (u-Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library is directed towards those in need of a library for developing signal processing or data analysis applications that makes heavy use of matrix and vector manipulation. The primary design goals are:
• Provide MATLAB like interface to uBLAS.
•	Adding richer interface but staying close to the design style of Boost uBLAS.
•	Non intrusive extension of uBLAS while preserving efficiency and maximizing code reuse.
•	Aid faster porting of MATLAB code to C++.
